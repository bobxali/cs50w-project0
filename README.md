## Adanced Google Search
This project is part of the CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. The objective is to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

 In this project, a simple clone of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search will be created using HTML and CSS. The aim is to closely replicate the appearance and functionality of Google's search pages, including a search bar, search buttons, and various search options similar to Google's own advanced search features

## Specification

- The website consists of three pages: index.html for regular Google Search, a page for Google Image Search, and another for Google Advanced Search.
- Each page includes navigation links in the upper-right corner for easy switching between different search options.
- On the Google Search page, the user can type a search query into the centered search bar and click "Google Search" to see the search results.
- The search bar has rounded corners, and the search button is centered below it for a clean and visually appealing design.
- The Google Image Search page allows users to enter a search query, click the search button, and view the Google Image search results for that query.
- The Google Advanced Search page provides input fields for four search options: "Find pages with... all these words," "Find pages with... this exact word or phrase," "Find pages with... any of these words," and "Find pages with... none of these words."
- The four search options are stacked vertically, and all the text fields are left-aligned, just like Google's own design.
- The "Advanced Search" button has a blue background with white text, consistent with Google's styling.
- Clicking the "Advanced Search" button takes the user to the search results page for the given query.
- Additionally, an "I’m Feeling Lucky" button is added to the main Google Search page. Clicking this button takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- Note: The "I’m Feeling Lucky" button might trigger a redirect notice due to a security feature implemented by Google.
- The CSS is carefully crafted to resemble Google’s aesthetics.ayout to create an aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.
