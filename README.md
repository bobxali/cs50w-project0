## Adanced Google Search

 In this project, a simple clone of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search will be created using HTML and CSS. The aim is to closely replicate the appearance and functionality of Google's search pages, including a search bar, search buttons, and various search options similar to Google's own advanced search features

## Specification

 - The website must consist of three primary pages: Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

- Each page should include links in the upper-right corner, allowing visitors to navigate to other pages. For example, on the Google Search page, there should be links to access Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search. Similarly, on the other two pages, provide a link to return to the Google Search page.

- On the Google Search page, visitors should find a centered search bar where they can input their queries. After clicking the "Google Search" button, they will be redirected to the corresponding Google search results page.

- To maintain Google's design aesthetics, the search bar should have rounded corners, and the "Google Search" button should be centered below the search bar.

- The Google Image Search page should allow users to enter a query and view the search results for images.

- On the Google Advanced Search page, visitors should be able to provide inputs for four fields: "Find pages with all these words," "Find pages with this exact word or phrase," "Find pages with any of these words," and "Find pages with none of these words." These options should be displayed vertically, and the text fields should be left-aligned.

- To match Google's design, use a blue "Advanced Search" button with white text. Clicking this button should redirect users to the search results page corresponding to their query.

- Include an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page. When clicked, users should be directly redirected to the first search result for their query, bypassing the regular search results page.

- Ensure the website's CSS closely resembles Google's design and layout to create an aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.
